	    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	    <p>
	    	A longboard is a type of sports equipment similar to, but not the same as, a skateboard. It is often longer than a skateboard and has a wide variety of shapes. It tends to be faster because of wheel size, construction materials and more precise hardware. Longboards are commonly used for cruising, downhill racing, slalom racing, sliding, dancing, long distance racing, and transport.

	    <h2>History</h2>
	    <p>
	    	The first longboards were made by Hawaiian surfers in the 1940s and 50s as an alternative when the waves were too dull. Early skaters built dangerous, improvised boards out of planks of wood and roller skates in a practice known as Sidewalk Surfing.[2] Manufactured Longboards first became commercially available in 1959 when Makaha, Jack's, and Hobie became the first professional longboard distributors.[3] These early longboards were still relatively crude, as they still featured metal wheels, but later had clay wheels due to improved safety factors. Longboarding became a popular activity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but its popularity had largely died by 1965. Longboarding made a comeback in 1972 when Frank Nasworthy and the Cadillac Wheel Company introduced the urethane longboard wheel.[4] Urethane wheels allowed skaters to reach very high downhill speeds which were not possible before. Standard vertical kingpin skate trucks at the time could not maintain stability at these speeds. In the 1990s, Sector 9 developed the reverse kingpin skate truck. The reverse kingpin trucks stability and maneuverability helped downhill longboarding grow into a legitimate sport, with the International Gravity Sports Association (IGSA) as its governing body.[5] The 90's also saw the introduction of the cutout deck, which has sections cut out around the wheels to prevent the wheels from touching the board during hard turns. Longboard technology has evolved rapidly to accommodate unique modern skating disciplines including downhill, slalom, freeriding, dancing, and freestyle. Modern longboard decks can be made from a variety of materials including fiberglass composites, aluminum, and carbon fiber. Precision trucks, which are machined with cutting edge CNC technology instead of die casting with molds, offer more strength and maneuverability than cast trucks and have achieved popularity among professional skaters.[6][better source needed]

	    <h2>Equipment & protection</h2>
	    <p>
	    The ‘helmet culture’ is more prevalent in longboarding than in skateboarding.[10] Most riders wear protective equipment in all disciplines, and nearly all professionals wear a helmet and gloves. Longboard protective equipment is similar to standard skateboard equipment, with the exception of slide gloves. Most longboarders wear slide gloves and helmets,[11] as these are considered the bare minimum for protection. Additional protection includes: leathers, wrist guards, knee pads, elbow pads and sometimes spine protectors and padded shorts. Many professional longboarding teams and riders are required to wear and advocate all aspects of protection. In the sliding and downhill disciplines, riders wear "slide gloves" which are specialized gloves made out of a strong materials such as leather and synthetic fabrics, and have large discs called "pucks" attached to the palms. These are attached to protect the hands as the rider uses them to pivot during slides along the ground. The pucks are usually made of synthetic polymers: delrin, UHMW, or corian.
